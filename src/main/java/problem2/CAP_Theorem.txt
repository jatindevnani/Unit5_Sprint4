//CAP Theorem
 --> The CAP stands for 
 	(C) Consistency -> Data is consistent among all Nodes
 	(A) Availability -> All nodes are always available
 	(P) Partition Tolerance -> If if there is a break in communication b/w any two nodes, the system will still operate.
 	
 	These three are the most sought after properties of any distributed system.
 	The CAP theorem states that no distributed system can achieve more than any two
 	of the above at a single point of time.
 	
 	The CAP theorem lets you determine how you want to handle your distributed database
 	when a few database servers refuse to communicate with each other. It can also help in choosing a 
 	database for your system e.g. SQL, noSQL 
 	
 	If high availability is required. Consistency cannot be achieved.
 	If High consistency is required, Partition tolerance will be low.
 	If high partition tolerance is required, Consistency cannot be achieved.

//Question-4

1) What do you know about the Client server architecture?
	--> Client Server Architecture has 2 basic components as the name suggests. The first is the Client, 
		and it REQUESTS for the information from the server. The request is sent to the server and which 
		can be any type of query or an update. It can be a query on the database or simply something 
		required from the service layer. 
		
		The Server than processes the request and sends the response to the client. 
		

2) What is caching and its use cases?
	--> Caching is storing of data such that the future request of the data can be fulfilled faster.
		Cache usually contains data that is requested often.
		
		Caching is most useful where the same thing is accessed again and again and it takes a lot
		of time or computing power to get the data again and again.
		
		It can also be useful where the server response time is too high because of the distance
		between the main server and the request destination. In this case, a "cache" is placed
		at each destination which saves the data requested from the server to serve the future 
		requests.
		

3) What are web sockets and where are they useds?
	--> Web sockets enable live handshake between the server and the user. HTTP is stateless which
	means that every request is distinct from the other but in the case of Web Sockets, every request
	is a part of the connection pool.
	
	They are most used where live connections are required
	for e.g. Multiplayer games, chatting application etc.
	
	
4) What are the public and private keys in encryption?
	--> Public keys and private keys are both used in encryption. The public key is given to the public
		while the private key is distinct and protected for the particular user. Both are used at the 
		time of encryption but only the user with the corresponding private key can decrypt the data.

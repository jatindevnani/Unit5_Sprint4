//Operating system and its responsibilities

--> An Operating system is the layer between between  a computer user and the hardware components.
	it performs all the basic tasks like managing the memory, managing the processes, it handles the 
	connections of peripherals etc.
	
	Operating System e.g --> Windows, MAC, Android, Linux etc.
	
--> Features of an Operating system
	a) Memory Management
		There are two types of memories in a computer. One is the RAM and the other is the ROM
		An operating system manages both these memories. It allots the required RAM automatically
		to the running processes as well.
		
	b) Processor Management
		Every task running in the background requires some CPU (Central Processing Unit) power
		This is a very crucial task and the operating system takes care of this work very
		efficiently. It allocates and deallocates the cores to the processes
		
	c) Device Management
		Operating system generally detects new devices connected to the computer and makes them 
		ready to use for the user. The user can also install the driver software to make the connected
		hardware component ready to use in case it is not detected by the operating system.
		
	d) Security
		Now a days the operating system usually comes with inbuilt security against mal-wares and viruses
		
	e) Optimization of performance
		Operating system automatically closes dead processes in the background and clears the memory 
		automatically. It is always performing optimizations in the background.
